Student Enrollment: Allows students to register for courses, view schedules, and track academic progress.
Course Management: Faculty can create, edit, and manage courses and assign grades.
Faculty Management: Administrators can manage faculty details and assign them to courses.
Grading System: Allows faculty to grade assignments and exams, with automatic calculation of final grades.
Attendance Tracking: Faculty can record and view student attendance.
Student Dashboard: Displays course enrollment, attendance, grades, and other relevant information.
Admin Dashboard: Allows administrators to manage users, courses, and overall university data.
üñ•Ô∏è Software Requirements
Java 8 or above
JDK 1.8 or later for compiling and running the project
MySQL for database management

üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure
The database for University Management System (UMS) includes the following tables:

signup (Stores user details):
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE signup (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);
courses (Stores course information):
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    course_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    credits INT NOT NULL
);
enrollment (Stores student-course enrollment data):
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE enrollment (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES signup(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
attendance (Stores student attendance records):
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    attendance_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES signup(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
grades (Stores grades for each student in each course):
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE grades (
    grade_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade DOUBLE,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES signup(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
Example Dummy Data for Students and Courses:
Users: Students and faculty members with their roles (student, faculty, admin).
Courses: Courses like "Computer Science 101", "Mathematics 101", "Physics 101", etc.
Enrollment: Records of which students are enrolled in which courses.
Attendance: Tracks if students attended specific classes.
Grades: Records of the grades assigned to students for each course.
Next Steps and Considerations:
UI Design: Ensure a clean, user-friendly UI for students, faculty, and admins. Use Swing to design responsive components.
Database Integration: Test all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for seamless database interaction.
Advanced Features: You could add features like notifications for grade updates or new announcements.
Security: Add security measures like password hashing to protect user credentials.
This system will streamline university management by automating tasks such as course registration, grading, attendance, and overall data handling.
